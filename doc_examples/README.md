# Example user-facing documentation for large datasets

This folder contains a few text files that are provided
as examples of user documentation, when large datasets
are stored in SquashFS files. They demonstrate how users
can access the datasets, and provide hints and links
to other resources (including this GitHub repo).

The two READMEs you can find here are actual documents
that the ACE lab created for two of our datasets (HCP1200,
and a collection of FMRIprep outputs).
